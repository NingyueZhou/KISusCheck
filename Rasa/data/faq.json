Some regional specialties may have a protected geographical indication (PGI), which means that only one stage of production needs to take place in the named area. For example, the pork used in 'Black Forest ham' may not always come from the Black Forest, but the traditional production of the ham takes place in the region.

They do not say the same thing about a product, but represent different requirements for the type and quality of production or animal husbandry. In Germany, the following seals are widely used for organic farming. \n\n - EU organic seal according to the EC organic regulation:The seal identifies pre-packaged organic food from the EU that meets the strict standards of EU legislation for organic farming.\n\n - German organic seal according to the EC Organic Regulation:In addition to the mandatory EU organic logo, manufacturers can label their organic products with theGerman organic sealand mark the marks of private associations and trademarks.\n\n - Bioland logo:Bioland stands for a transparent origin of raw materials and food, regional supply chains and responsible organic farming from Germany and South Tyrol. The strict guidelines go far beyond the EU organic standard: they promote biodiversity and animal welfare, save resources and protect the environment. Bioland animals live in species-appropriate animal husbandry with plenty of freedom of movement and feed from organic farming. The Bioland values and guidelines are shared and implemented by organic farms from agriculture, beekeeping and viticulture and companies from processing and trading.\n\n - Demeter stands for consistent organic food that is produced in harmony with nature. Due to the living circular economy, Demeter agriculture is considered the most sustainable form of land management.Demeter farmers build up soil fertility and maintain the soil by using biological fertilizers, not chemical ones, such as compost, manure and green manure or biodynamic preparations.They ensure the preservation of biodiversity: Biodynamic breeders ensure diversity on our plates with seed-proof vegetables and cereals.The Demeter-certified farms adapt the barn to the needs of the animals: the barn is adapted to the cow and not the cow to the barn.\n\n - Naturland logo: Naturland has aholistic concept based on three pillars of sustainability: organic, social and fair. Naturland's requirements for farms go far beyond the EU organic regulation:\n\n 1-The entire farm has to be converted to organic for both crop production and animal husbandry. Fertilization and feeding are more strictly regulated and there are detailed guidelines for all processing methods and areas.\n\n 2- In addition, there are binding social guidelines for all Naturland operations, which primarily include compliance with human rights and basic labor rights. Naturland also covers areas such as ecological aquaculture, sustainable fishing and ecological forest use.\n\n 3- Naturland is international, with member companies in Germany and around 60 other countries. WNaturland also certifies products such as coffee, cocoa and coconut around the world.”\n\n - Bio circle:Biokreis stands for regional and trusting networks, for animal welfare and artisanal food processing in harmony with nature. Biokreis-certified companies throughout Germany operate according to Biokreis guidelines, which go well beyond the EU organic standards. Biokreis members convert their entire business to organic farming. The food produced contains fewer additives and mostly comes from artisanal processing.\n\n - Biopark:Certified agricultural businesses, but also bakeries, butcher shops and other processing companies carry this seal. Many farms that bear this seal cultivate areas in nature and landscape protection areas. This shows that agriculture and nature conservation can be in harmony. The guidelines of the Biopark require a complete conversion of the farm, exercise, grazing and farm-own feed. Both the feed for the animals and all Biopark products contain almost exclusively local Biopark raw materials.\n\n - Ecoland: The Ecoland companies must comply with the specifications of the EU organic regulation and also the Ecoland guidelines.The Association for Organic Farming and Food Sector stands for the preservation and promotion of the agricultural cultural landscape, the protection of the environment and the preservation of the natural basis of life through adapted and ecologically and biologically compatible farming. In addition, it is committed to promoting social and fair conditions in agriculture, processing and trade.\n\n -Association of organic farms:Arable and vegetable farmers, orchard farmers, livestock farms, seed and herb farmers as well as processing companies belong to the Association of Organic Farms.

In Germany, the following seals are widely used for organic farming. \n\n - EU organic seal according to the EC organic regulation:The seal identifies pre-packaged organic food from the EU that meets the strict standards of EU legislation for organic farming.\n\n - German organic seal according to the EC Organic Regulation:In addition to the mandatory EU organic logo, manufacturers can label their organic products with theGerman organic sealand mark the marks of private associations and trademarks.\n\n - Bioland logo:Bioland stands for a transparent origin of raw materials and food, regional supply chains and responsible organic farming from Germany and South Tyrol. The strict guidelines go far beyond the EU organic standard: they promote biodiversity and animal welfare, save resources and protect the environment. Bioland animals live in species-appropriate animal husbandry with plenty of freedom of movement and feed from organic farming. The Bioland values and guidelines are shared and implemented by organic farms from agriculture, beekeeping and viticulture and companies from processing and trading.\n\n - Demeter stands for consistent organic food that is produced in harmony with nature. Due to the living circular economy, Demeter agriculture is considered the most sustainable form of land management.Demeter farmers build up soil fertility and maintain the soil by using biological fertilizers, not chemical ones, such as compost, manure and green manure or biodynamic preparations.They ensure the preservation of biodiversity: Biodynamic breeders ensure diversity on our plates with seed-proof vegetables and cereals.The Demeter-certified farms adapt the barn to the needs of the animals: the barn is adapted to the cow and not the cow to the barn.\n\n - Naturland logo: Naturland has aholistic concept based on three pillars of sustainability: organic, social and fair. Naturland's requirements for farms go far beyond the EU organic regulation:\n\n 1-The entire farm has to be converted to organic for both crop production and animal husbandry. Fertilization and feeding are more strictly regulated and there are detailed guidelines for all processing methods and areas.\n\n 2- In addition, there are binding social guidelines for all Naturland operations, which primarily include compliance with human rights and basic labor rights. Naturland also covers areas such as ecological aquaculture, sustainable fishing and ecological forest use.\n\n 3- Naturland is international, with member companies in Germany and around 60 other countries. WNaturland also certifies products such as coffee, cocoa and coconut around the world.”\n\n - Bio circle:Biokreis stands for regional and trusting networks, for animal welfare and artisanal food processing in harmony with nature. Biokreis-certified companies throughout Germany operate according to Biokreis guidelines, which go well beyond the EU organic standards. Biokreis members convert their entire business to organic farming. The food produced contains fewer additives and mostly comes from artisanal processing.\n\n - Biopark:Certified agricultural businesses, but also bakeries, butcher shops and other processing companies carry this seal. Many farms that bear this seal cultivate areas in nature and landscape protection areas. This shows that agriculture and nature conservation can be in harmony. The guidelines of the Biopark require a complete conversion of the farm, exercise, grazing and farm-own feed. Both the feed for the animals and all Biopark products contain almost exclusively local Biopark raw materials.\n\n - Ecoland: The Ecoland companies must comply with the specifications of the EU organic regulation and also the Ecoland guidelines.The Association for Organic Farming and Food Sector stands for the preservation and promotion of the agricultural cultural landscape, the protection of the environment and the preservation of the natural basis of life through adapted and ecologically and biologically compatible farming. In addition, it is committed to promoting social and fair conditions in agriculture, processing and trade.\n\n -Association of organic farms:Arable and vegetable farmers, orchard farmers, livestock farms, seed and herb farmers as well as processing companies belong to the Association of Organic Farms. You must comply with the requirements of the EU organic regulation and also comply with the guidelines of the organic farms association, for example on production, arable farming, livestock and fertilization.",

Thanks to this voluntary labeling, consumers can see at a glance where the main ingredients of a product come from and where they were processed. The regional window makes it easier to identify regional foods and can thus promote conscious shopping.\n\n In Bavaria there are the following seals, among others:\n\n'Approved Quality Bavaria': The state quality and origin assurance program 'Approved Quality Bavaria' guarantees the quality of regional food across all stages in Bavaria.These products are manufactured and processed exclusively in Bavaria.

These include the consumption of non-renewable resources, the generation of emissions, and the consumption of resources during disposal and recycling. Some materials are expensive to produce but can be more easily recycled. Glass is relatively heavy, suitable for reuse and for recycling. Plastic is light and not very energy-intensive but difficult to recycle.",
