It should taken into account become, if and which trade offs exist. This meets e.g. to, if only separate criteria are considered, e.g. a lower CO 2 footprint implies an intensification of pro- production, How approximately at Milk, tied together with lesser environmental pollution. A concrete Example might clearly, that a more differentiated View on the connections necessary is: One 10,000 l Cow has a CO 2 footprint of 1.0 kg CO 2 eq./kg milk, with 2.7 lactations, vs. a 6,000 l organic cow, with approx. 1.0 to 1.2 kg CO 2 eq./kg milk and 4.7 lactations (cf. FiBL, 2017). The increase in the annual yield of a cow reduces the "required number of animals on the farm" and thus the accumulation of greenhouse gases (TGH) such as than and nitrous oxide (Brade, 2014). At the same time it turns out that the higher the milk yield, the lower one possible saving effect of TGH potential (Antony, 2021). Simultaneously goes one increase the ecological cal milk production is accompanied by disadvantages in terms of energy expenditure and land use (Antony, 2021). Animal welfare and biodiversity aspects would also have to be taken into account at this point. terms 1 . As well the Theme generation and marketing from the Beef.



3.1.1  individual indicators

carbon footprint _


The carbon footprint _ (engl. carbon footprint) becomes also as carbon footprint _ or greenhouse gas balance designated not. He gives at, How many carbon dioxide emissions direct and indirect through one activity caused become or arise over the life stages of a product. Besides carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) flow often other greenhouse gases such as methane or nitrogen monoxide also contribute to the CO 2 footprint by CO 2 equivalents (short CO 2 eq.) be converted (nu3, 2021).

A study by the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research (Ifeu) makes it clear that it is not just “the There is a "footprint" of a food, as this depends on numerous boundary conditions. The published Data to the carbon footprints _ from groceries soft partially clearly from each other the away. This deviations result itself often out of the respective question. So might it for example makes a big difference whether only domestic production is considered or whether imports are included and thus the annual average for food sold in Germany is included in the calculation. The situation is different again when it comes to a specific product such as regional and seasonal strawberries goes. In addition, CO 2 emissions from land use and land use change in many Studies not included (Ifeu, 2020). Not only the production is decisive for the ecological physical footprint, but also the type of transport, packaging and preservation of the food. Out of environmental view should for example on flown in Products waived become (ibid.). Simultaneously puts the WBAE report represent, that "one regional generation out of one sustainability perspective is not always the first choice, and reusable packaging is not (always) environmentally cher as disposable packaging are" (WBAE, 2020).

That also the food choices a Influence has, shows itself at the accounting from ready to eat dishes. Small recipe changes, such as substituting plant-based products for animal products, can decisive for be the overall balance and therewith offer savings potential.

Selected factors the one Influence on the carbon footprints _ from groceries have:

cultivation methods or. management forms

formulations (e.g fat content)

The comparison of the two forms of production (organic and conventional) showed that with increasing milk yield, the emissions out of digestion and fertilizer storage lose weight, for this the greenhouse gas emissions at the generation energetic greedy feed increases. A reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is possible through a balanced humus and nutrient balance in forage production, improved longevity and milk yield of the cows as well as an efficient heifer rearing possible at one simultaneously further waiver on import feed (Soy) possible (brade, 2014).

In addition to the greenhouse gases, other ecological footprints also play a role. Therefore, in the study of the Ifeu additionally water, surface and phosphate footprints as well as the energy requirements for approx. 30 Le- food calculated.

viewing worse. However, the aspect of animal welfare is forgotten in this approach as well as a feeding without imported goods. However, this is an important one, for example from the point of view of the consumer Sales argument, because a "turbo mast" is not desired, also with regard to sustainability. It is also forgotten here that in certain geographic regions with a high proportion of permanent grassland only a ruminant husbandry as a source of food with meat and dairy products is possible. Another point that is not taken into account by a carbon footprint is the quality of the meat . cal, such as flavor, veining, or marbling of the meat due to a particular beef breed race or one longer grazing time on a species-rich Pasture.

water footprint


Another individual indicator is the water footprint. The water footprint is a Indicator for the use of water as a resource. The water footprint takes into account the so-called virtual water - and illustrates the human influence on water as a resource. Any product claims virtual water. That means it has a water footprint. And this one is mostly far greater than the visible amount of water consumed. According to the Federal Environment Agency, “more than half of the water for the required products and goods not from Germany” (UBA, 2021). Meat, Coffee and tea to count to the so-called thirsty goods – so products, the particularly What- serene intensive in of their manufacturing as well as her import are (p. Cape. 3.1.1.6). regional and seasonal Products reduce the consumption of virtual water, among other things, by avoiding imports (Swiss, 2020). concrete examples are in the study of Ifeu (Ifeu, 2020) as well as above the Water footprint network 2 to find.

The water footprint makes it possible to compare the water consumption of different products (cf. 

and offers the possibility of examining the influence of individual consumption on the global Present and compare water resources. For the calculation of the water footprint is done loud Ifeu one "Weighting the different consumed amounts of water after the Water scarcity, prevailing in each country where the consumption takes place” (Ifeu, 2020). The basis is the A WARE method after Boulay, 2018 3 (ibid.).

phosphate footprint


Rock phosphate is mined outside of Germany. Contributes to the phosphate footprint of food primarily the phosphate at, the as fertilizer for the agricultural production needed becomes. Added to this are phosphates, which are processed foods (e.g. fast food, ready meals, lemonades) added become. The Recording from phosphates above the food takes to and can maybe to healthy- cause serious damage. The phosphate values for the foods given in are “in Grams of phosphate rock equivalents given. This will increase the mass of phosphate-bearing rock referred to, which is consumed for 1 kilogram of the food" (cf. Ifeu, 2020). More information to delivers the report of Ifeu to the "Fixation of indicator for the accounting the resource phosphate in environmental assessments (Ifeu, 2019).

nitrogen footprint


Also Nitrogen becomes as fertilizer deployed and leaves therewith a nitrogen footprint with Environment-and health effects (e.g about the groundwater). excess nitrogen in of agriculture ancestral

The agricultural sector contributes significantly to Germany-wide nitrous oxide and methane emissions (N 2 O 79%, CH 4 63% (UBA2021)). But it can also be crucial to solving this problem
