.g. meat vs. apples). The data of the Planet Score are based on the Agribalyse database. Here are at least 2,500 product categories listed. As described, the Planet Score considers some indicators that are not or only rarely included in the LCA recorded become.

Mission from Pesticides: Here becomes also the Effect on the human and plans- tare Health considered as well as the presence from crop protection products in groceries.

Climate: Next to soil carbon stocks become also greenhouse gas emissions taken into account.








Biodiversity: Takes into account effects associated with the use of pesticides, but also the Size from agricultural punches and the To be available from landscape elements ment How eg hedges.

animal welfare: consideration different animal welfare standards

Next to the Depiction the four individually evaluated indicators becomes a overall value issued.

Large qualitative studies that have already been carried out should show that this logo ment at the Choice more sustainable Products supports (Foodnavigator.com, 2021). 16 organizations want the Support Planet Score (ibid.).


Further seal and approaches


In the following become further seal and approaches short described. On it becomes not closer received out of and G. Found. These seals become at the rating only limited consideration.

The Pro Planet label as a private label “stands at REWE, Penny, Nahkauf and Toom-Bau-market for products that have been produced in a more ecologically and socially sustainable manner or meet the highest animal welfare standards” (PRO PLANET, 2021). The "quite demanding" pro- Planet Program identifies problem areas (“hot spots”) to fix or mend However, there are doubts about this concept ("the company certifies itself self") (cf. Winterer, 2017).

The rain forest Alliance is after own Declarations "worldwide leading in the sustainability certification fication” (Rainforest Alliance, 2021). She works on the four topics of forests, climate, living conditions and human rights. The aspects of certification, landscape management, advocacy and supply chain services. "UTZ certified" is also part of the Rainforest Alliance. The certified products include coffee, cocoa, tea, bananas, palm oil and coconut oil. However, the requirements of the seal fall far short of the organic and fair trade seal return.

WWF: The nature conservation organization WWF (World Wide Fund For Nature) supports the Sustainability communication in food retail, for example together with EDEKA. This also leads to the throw, the bandage stand to close at the Industry 5 .

Blue Angel: The label is mainly used for non-food items and environmentally friendly products services, and is a federal government eco-label. Excellent become etc climate friendly sales markets such as Tegut markets.


A ecopoints model is a possible Approach, around the ecosystem services in the Frame the agra- fresh land use to capture and state to honor. This labels could for the a the food medium processors and -dealers of their Purchasing Policy help, for the others the consumer ment at the Choice of their Groceries (unprocessed Products but also processed Products).

Food waste : No known label indicates whether and to what extent the men food waste or avoidance of food waste throughout the production tion must be taken into account. According to the WWF, 1.3 billion tons of edible food are consumed worldwide every Year thrown away (WWF, 2021). This has not only ecological, but also social Effects.



3.2	Health

3.2.1  Nutri Score

The Nutri-Score is suitable as a tool for evaluating the health aspect of a sustainable Nourishment. However, he makes no statements about the effects of nutrition on the resource consumption . The Nutri-Score is a five-point scale with a combination of book and rods from A until E and Colors, the at one Traffic light ajar are (dark green, light green, yellow, orange and red). The Labelling gives one overall rating on the basis one calculation algorithm at, the show should, How more or fewer advantageous the nutrient profile one food is. The consumption chers should be easier and more transparent when shopping for health-promoting food choices. And manufacturers should also be encouraged to use healthier nutrition substance composition of the products (DLG, 2021). Small recipe tweaks, about one Fat or salt reduction can the Nutri Score essential change.

The Nutri-Score is a voluntary label. The national introduction of enhanced nutritional identification is not mandatory under current EU law. Seen across Europe, the Nutri- score a possibility the extended nutritional labeling.

The calculation of Nutri scores he follows on 100 gram basis one product:

Included receive as positive rated nutrient and ingredients (Protein, fiber, Fruit, Vegetables, Nuts) negative points.

As negative rated nutrient (Energy, saturated fatty acids, Sugar, Salt) receive positive tive points.

Both are offset against each other: the lower the total number of points, the higher the overall rating tion .



















Criticism : However, no assessment approaches for micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) or Secondary plant compounds (flavonoids, phenolic acids, etc.) are also recorded. Likewise, certain material Characteristics not included. A essential Disadvantage, if the Nutri Score alone considered becomes, is also, that the environmental impact at the manufacturing of product not taken into account who- the. here can it even to one deception come (e.g. rice cake).


The corn/rice cakes have a class A Nutri-Score. However, they have a pure Nutri-Score no environmental impacts of the two raw materials have been taken. According to the product labeling, this is not the case clarified, if it itself at the rice cultivation around wet rice or dry rice acts. The carbon footprint _ from Wet-rice is 6.1 kg CO 2 /kg rice, that of dry rice 4.3 kg CO 2 / kg rice. In comparison, 1 kg Pork has a footprint of 3.26 kg CO 2 / kg and 1 kg of potatoes has a footprint of 0.62 kg CO2 / kg Potatoes.







3.2.2  NOVA system

The NOVA system gives the Degree the processing from groceries at:

This system does not take into account energy and nutrient content, but food quality and degree of processing . This system results from the recommendation that foods should be largely unprocessed processed and untreated (i.e. natural) to eat. At the same time, processed, i.e. industrially asked groceries one higher carbon footprint .

3.2.3  food safety

The Theme food safety becomes here not treated, also if the Freedom from individual return standing How crop protection products and microplastics already on packagings offered become and so- with indirect on sustainable / environmentally oriented modes of production conclusions give should. simultaneous This is an important topic for many consumers, and the claim that organic qualities does not appear to be resolved, although stricter controls take place here (keyword: missing Trust the consumers in organic, see. 6 ).



3.3	animal welfare

The various help here labeling approaches - with their different characteristics, from Initiative Tierwohl (ITW), the state animal welfare label to trade labels . they say However, nothing about animal welfare (animal behavior, condition, etc.) as a whole, as with the approaches often only the forms of husbandry (e.g. substantial amount of space/m² and activity material) are described. However, not every (existing) label takes into account important indicators such as animal health or use of medication. The topics of animal husbandry, transport and slaughter are also discussed not or only hardly taken into account.

Marktforschung.de (2022): 





At the Selection the forms of identification should observed become, which legal Requirements already exist or will come. It should also be noted which measures are taken by companies of the food retail trade, e.g. delisting of products with a certain husbandry stage, sale of eggs without killing chicks, implementation of 5xD (birth, rearing, fattening, slaughter, Dismantling/Processing in Germany).

In the future, the production and consumption of in vitro meat will also be activity effects to be viewed as must.

3.3.1  animal welfare in ecologically and conventional economizing farms

Basically, there are only a few comparative studies on animal welfare in organically or conventionally farmed operating companies. Existing studies mainly relate to individual effects and milk cows. With regard to animal health, the evaluated studies on all livestock species and production no clear picture in all directions . Management seems to matter more than the question ecological or conventional. Regarding animal behavior and emotional state, the few show studies advantages of ecological livestock farming (WBAE, 2020).

3.3.2  animal welfare and climate protection

From the point of view of climate protection, the productivity of livestock farming for pigs or give high priority. However, very rapid growth and very high performance are often possible associated with animal welfare problems. To some extent, improved postural environments can and breeding for functional traits relevant to animal welfare mitigate conflicting goals, however this Approach also limits. Out of animal welfare perspective is for the most livestock in the today's internal sive attitude a “ de-intensification ” necessary (WBAE, 2020).

greenhouse gas emissions from products animal Origin lay as well as based on the Unit energy as also on the Unit protein across from vegetable Sources around a multiple higher – based on effects in Attitude, Feeding, further processing Etc. One reduction of share from groceries animal Origin at the total consumption would to positive climate protection effects to lead – whereby Trade off to take into account are.

3.3.3  Wild, fish and insects

The rearing or husbandry and consumption of game, fish and insects should also be sustainable activity evaluation taken into account become.
