Game meat comes in many cases from species-appropriate living animals. If the game from the region stems from is venison aside from that through short Transport routes marked.

fish : Under sustainable fishing understands man, that the used fishing methods and her To whom- tion keep the fish stocks at a stock-maintaining level and do not destroy them in their reproductive ability is restricted. Furthermore, sustainable fishing aims to reduce the impact on the Minimize marine ecology and unwanted catches as much as possible. All of these goals are in the common fisheries policy of the EU (CFP) committed. Current exist two Seal:

MSC seal : The marine stewardship Council (MSC) is one independent, non-profit inter national organization to the certification from fisheries after environmental impact criteria. In a lengthy process, certifiers check whether the fisheries meet the standards of the MSC speak. However, the MSC has some shortcomings, e.g. it no longer corresponds to the current current state of the art and the best available methods. The WWF is looking at that MSC seal as a minimum standard for wild fish. Requirements for sustainable production are however higher (WWF, 2021a).






The ASC standard (Aquaculture stewardship Council) puts itself for more environmentally friendly aquaculture doors. Arctic char, oysters, tilapia, pangasius, salmon, shrimp, Trout and mussels available with the ASC seal. There is criticism of the use of fishmeal and oil or from GMO soy (ibid.).


A premium label for farmed fish puts e.g. the Naturland certification represent.

Insects : Reasons for the increasing attractiveness of insects as so-called Novel Food are the high yield nutritional value (high protein content, rich in vitamins and nutrients) and the cost- and resource-resource-friendly rearing. Already 50% of the 14 to 29 year old German population can imagine the Imagine the consumption of insects as a measure to be able to feed the growing population in the future (forsa Nutrition Report 2019/2020). According to Meticulous Research (via Bloomberg, 2019), this will change market volume in Europe until for the Years 2023 with 218.5 % in the Comparison to 2018 quadrupled have (Euro fins Germany, 2020). Europe-wide are valid food insects and insectic Groceries as novelty le food. In 2021, the larva of the yellow mealworm (lat. Tenebrio molitor) became part of the family the black beetle as novelty Groceries authorized (ibid.).

Naturland was the first organic association to issue guidelines for sustainable insect production and so on the market importance from insects reacted.



3.4	social

It consist different sustainability rating systems for social Criteria:

Decent work: a concept recognized worldwide, developed by the competent UN organization ILO, basis for many sustainability assessments

SAFA the FAO, also basis many sustainability assessments

Fair trade: familiar labels in the trade (please refer: GEPA - the Fair Trade company)

Global CAP GRASP: directs itself not at consumers, rather at the Trade, focus is the food safety

COROS: from IFOAM for the organic farming

DLG Sustainability standard: in Germany developed system for agricultural loading drove

Rain Forest Alliance (p. Environment, Chapter 

Living wagers: The so-called Living Wage Initiatives step "for one substantial increase from minimum wages a. The idea of living dare go from the right on a Salary out of, the








not only the physical Reproduction, rather also one social and cultural participation at the Company enabled" (see. 7 ).

we Care: under private law default for sustainable management systems in the Groceries-industry (see below)

About it out gives it isolated private logos the Pursue eg from Rapunzel health food (Hand in Hand, Organic Rapunzel fair trade).


parent Goals the labels/ certifications are:

more appropriate livelihood

labor rights / working conditions

equal rights

Security and Health

cultural diversity

social aspects the manager regarding

social concerns

The most known evaluation and labeling approaches capture however only separate aspects the After-durability dimensions. Essential aspects are human rights, working conditions (health and political Activities) and livelihood wages (significant for the People in the global South). aspects How gender ratio, health care or Continuing education capture the least system theme/label (p. fair trade or Rain Forest Alliance and transition periods at living dares).

Only a few approaches also consider the fair aspect for the Global North or Germany. At- by way of play are the current milk prices not cost-covering and make possible at one low Per- production level (e.g 6,000 l Cow) no operational Further development/livelihood reward the farmers.

It is therefore often not clear whether minimum social standards are being met. The social footprint will often only insufficiently recorded and is not or only hardly recognizable for consumers. Besides that becomes e.g. not taken into account, How country acquired becomes or if it. for the country grabbing - one often illegal appropriation from land area comes.

In addition to these criteria, there are other criteria and further approaches. One of these approaches is the Common Good Economy . This concept also includes social criteria such as human dignity, solidarity darity and justice as well as transparency and co-decision.


social aspects within from Pursue become also through a LCA not recorded. This should through the We Care standard are taken into account. This is a “management standard for the implementation and certification of sustainability requirements at company locations and in supply chain management for companies in the food industry worldwide” (We care, 2021). The four Fields of action of the We Care standard are:

corporate governance

supply chain management

employee responsibility


WSI (2022):  





environmental management

Management systems that already exist in companies are treated with We care during certification considers.

3.5	digression: vegetable  meat substitutes

Substituting animal products with vegetables, nuts and legumes results in systems nergies with health and environmental goals (e.g. reduction of diet-related diseases or reduction of emissions). The use of domestic legumes should also make a contribution to national protein plant strategy or. -care and with it to the reduction from (critical) Soy- contribute imports. At the same time, the questions a) where are the vegetables, nuts and the legumes cultivated – acts it itself around a (bio-)regional vs. national Cultivation?

who- that other crops are supplanting or are additional areas required? c) how extensive or time-consuming is the manufacturing process of meat substitute products? Goal of a balanced healthy diet nourishment is it too, little processed products consume.

3.6	digression: Regional products

Regional products are very popular - but are they also sustainable? The WBAE is approaching this Theme about the four sustainability dimensions.

sustainability dimension health : unprocessed "natural" Groceries are not automatically health-promoting. The same applies to products from organic farming. However, some taste good Products eg tomatoes out of regional and seasonal cultivation better (Conflict of objectives yield / Taste).

Sustainability dimensions Environment and animal welfare: Positive effects on the environment and animal welfare can at one ecological food production develop - must but not. more decisive are the aspects How a Groceries otherwise produced / processed / stored becomes, to the consumers reached and whether the products are seasonal. In addition, smaller companies do not produce more public services as size establishments. Positive effects in this dimensions are according to WBAE "we- nig clearly".

Social sustainability dimension : Aspects here are higher added value for producers, higher Wages, Strengthening rural rooms Etc. This rated the WBAE too rather critical.











4. weighting the indicators and dimensions

creation one own Scoring Model/Weighting the dimensions

Around one comprehensive sustainability statement to meet, the itself on the Base of chosen sustainability activity model (3-, 4-, 5-dimensional model of sustainability), must a) be defined with which transparency is to be evaluated (i.e. which criteria are taken into account) b) with which weight the single ones Dimensions/Criteria proven become.

When deciding on the sustainability model of the WBAE, the aspect of health - say something is for consumers a health-promoting and consistent produced product - in the focus stand. Thus, a high weighting should be placed on the dimension of health, then on the form of environmental friendly production (Dimension Environment).

The aim of the information is a change towards a more sustainable diet, both for the individuals as also for the environment.

It should be noted that within the dimensions, individual criteria are also weighted is working become must, with it important aspects How eg biodiversity not forget become.

The basis for the weighting is the determination of the WBAE approach with its four sustainability dimensions Environment, social affairs, health and animal welfare.

The four dimensions include:

Health: One health-promoting Nourishment, the to one higher Life expectancy, more healthy years of life and more wellbeing for all contributes.

social: One Nourishment, the social minimum standards along from value chains ge guarantees.

Environment : A diet respectful of the environment and climate, which contributes to the medium and long term sustainability goals of Germany fits.

Animal welfare: A diet that supports more animal welfare and thus the changing ethical s claims the Company just becomes.


Within the 4 dimensions become different indicators to the Evaluation used.

In the first step, a -- ie the Ask, if all four dimensions on the product hold true.

4.1	overall rating the dimensions

If all 4 dimensions apply to a product, these are usually products with raw materials from the animal production (mono-products such
