 contribute, e.g. through the cultivation of renewable raw materials and the creation of biological ones CO 2 sinks in moors and forests.

However favor the country- and forestry land uses also the persistent biodivers sity (WBAE, 2020). With regard to the entire life cycle, the further production, Transport and trade levels, individually and together, average less than half of the burden on agriculture. However, there are exceptions, such as when transporting groceries by plane or in the case of very energy-intensive packaging. On the consumption side, too, there are look, it to take into account is applicable, see below (ibid.).

“Particularly problematic indirect land use effects result from the use of primary forests (primeval forests) or previous Protected areas such as moors. One Sustainable development of the food system therefore requires a combination of supply-side measures (both agricultural and economic de-intensification as well as ecological intensification) on the one hand and on the consumption side Measures on the other hand, especially reducing the consumption of animal products and food food losses” (WBAE, 2020).

In addition to intensively managed farms with a very high use of operating resources and narrow fruit extensively farmed conventional farms with varied crop rotation or more extensively follow Grassland use by suckler cows or extensive breeds. These different levels of intensity are also practiced in organic farming. In addition, in organic farming, the sluggish are (significantly) lower. Which in turn leads to a higher land consumption and larger environmental impact leads. Becomes e.g. at the production from milk more milk performance feed (esp out of soy) is used, the environmental impact also worsens (Antony, 2021). Since the topics use and -consumption always stronger at Meaning win, becomes itself future also the organic farming with the subjects "vertical farming" and aquaponics deal with must. Both can a Contribution to the urban Agriculture afford and to one reduction of land use contribute.

Intensification and specialization in agriculture, the (intensive) use of fertilizers and plant protection agents and an increase in field sizes with a simultaneous decrease in field edge streaks fen are essential Causes, the to one Loss at biodiversity to lead. But also the "landscape structure has a significant impact on biodiversity, particularly in fauna” (WBAE, 2020). However, various studies come to the conclusion that organically farmed land in many cases have a higher biodiversity. The WBAE report therefore recommends that land use systems teme to be evaluated in a region-specific and company-type-specific manner, since this has a considerable influence on the characteristics of the results (WBAE, 2020). A positive contribution to the preservation of the cultural landscape and biodiversity, for example, the care and valorization of regional products (e.g. orchards) afford. Also the credit this surfaces on the eco account from Pursue in the Frame from Substitute-or compensation payments were conceivable.

State funds are currently being used to limit soybean cultivation in Germany (about 1% of the import quantities) to advance. The result of this is that soybean cultivation, which is comparatively low-yield here (approx. 3.5 t/ha) a high-yield Wheat- (8th t/ha) or grain maize cultivation (10 t/ha) repressed and so a indirect land-use change elsewhere on the World promoted (WBAE, 2020).











At this point, the topics of “ green genetic engineering ” and the use of genetically modified tered organisms (GMO) should be mentioned. This, as well as green genetic engineering in general, will be seen from afar rejected by parts of the German population. It is feared that the use of GMOs will have high environmental and has health consequences. GMO-free products are considered more sustainable. However, the WBAE is of the opinion that this "is not justified according to the current state of scientific knowledge" (cf. WBAE, 2020). GMO feed (esp Soy) become in huge amounts imported and in the livestock farming deployed. However, they do not have to be labeled as GMOs. The same applies to additives or auxiliaries that be produced using white genetic engineering. However, there are more and more foods associated with the seal "without genetic engineering" marked are.

Simple solutions like general import bans help no further here either. The oil palm provides a higher oil yield per hectare than any other crop. plant, so that a simple substitution of palm oil with other vegetable oils creates additional land use tongue change would entail. Instead, comprehensive and verifiable sustainability efforts of agricultural trade and processors, which are being strengthened by political pressure should” (WBAE, 2020).


At the calculation of land footprint "he follows one weighting the different required surfaces after of their respective distance to one natural state 4 . The result values for the in selected foods are given in square meter years of natural area occupancy. For that which all differently used areas of a life cycle (such as for agriculture, roads, domestic industrial areas) in equivalents complete sealed surfaces converted, the for the respective food be taken for a year" (Ifeu, 2020). Further information on the area footprint also provides the report of the Federal Environment Agency Germany (UBA) on the "Development of consumer ted land use indicators” (UBA, 2017).

The table makes the range of fluctuation between the different products clear. Clearly also that favorable values in one indicator do not necessarily mean good values in the other indicators gates imply. Also the Degree the processing correlated not in everyone cases with unfavorable values.

The example of butter and margarine shows the role played by the origin of the raw materials in CO 2 -, water and land footprint, ie whether the raw materials are of plant or animal origin. The herbal product performs significantly better in terms of footprints. Among other things, this is on a lesser land use in the crop production across from the livestock farming attributed.

In addition, margarine and butter differ in their fatty acid composition. butter holds 60% saturated fat and 40% unsaturated fat. The former have a negative effect on the LDL cholesterol level, the latter have positive effects. The fatty acid composition of Marga- rine hangs against it essential from the in this included vegetable Oil and fats away. The Portion at saturated fat is around 25%.

3.1.2  assessment tools

Life cycles Assessment (LCA)


One approach to comparative ecological evaluation is the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA, Lebenszyk- lus analysis) or the product life cycle assessment (WBAE, 2020). In contrast to CO 2 and water footprint becomes at the LCA not only one environmental dimension considered. In one LCA becomes tried, "possibly all Environmental impacts of different functionally equivalent products or product groups in systematic table shape along of entire manufacturing process (ie of product life cycle, "cradle to grave" approach) to record and evaluate" (ibid.). This analysis should enable companies to to optimize processes. However, assumptions have to be made in some places. Besides that become social and economic aspects not taken into account.

The principles and rules for conducting LCAs have been defined in various ISO standards. placed. LCAs comprise the four elements: (1) definition of goal and scope of investigation , (2) the Inventory analysis

(3) the impact assessment and (4) the evaluation or interpretation (see ).

In phase 1 become the system limits Are defined, so which concrete process steps from the manufacturing should be taken into account until a product is consumed.
