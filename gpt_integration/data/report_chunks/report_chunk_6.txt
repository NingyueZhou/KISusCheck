4.2	weights within one dimension

Various indicators/criteria are selected within a dimension, which are classified according to their tion for this dimension and the information needs of the user is weighted. In doing so, existing scores that work with classes, such as Nutri-Score or Eco-Score, the individual classes one score forgive.

In addition to the product labels, there are also holistic company labels that cover all dimensions, including the Includes social dimension. These holistic approaches are often also about labeling at the product communicates.

4.2.4  dimension Environment

According to the WBAE 2020, the goal of the environment dimension is an environmentally and climate-friendly to establish sustainable food production that contributes to the medium and long-term sustainability activity goals of Germany fits. Measured becomes this through different indicators, How

eg climate balance as part of a life cycle assessment, but also the topics of eutrophication and toxicity should be taken into account, as should sustainable farming production method (conventional or ecological Agriculture), Measures to the organic diversity, Height of use of pesticides, water consumption, Origin the forage middle, genetic engineering and Circular thinking/regional supply chains.

To the complexity of an assessment of a sustainable environmentally and climate-friendly To do justice to food production, at least the following indicators/criteria should be Product (in a first step only mono products and products with low processing grade) taken into account become:

Standardized Values one life cycle assessment (LCA) from product categories (e.g created on Base the data from agribalysis)

production form

biodiversity

use of pesticides

GMO free

feed origin (at animal products, spec. Origin from soy)

regionality


The following evaluation keys are used for the individual indicators (p. Table 13):

The Evaluation the life cycle assessment he follows on Base from classes (A – E, s. above), eg analogous to the Eco score or Planet Score.

Conventional and ecological production methods are generally used as a form of production differentiated, with organic farming receiving the full number of points, the con- conventional no. judged becomes this through the Labelling with to the EU organic logo or additionally with one organic association mark.

If the topic of biodiversity is communicated, the evaluation is based on corresponding ing labels. Included becomes current one full score only at the Bioland label forgive, there this Association expressly one own mandatory Biodiversity Policy created.

Based on the above considerations is recommended to adhere to the four sustainability dimensions of the WBAE orientate.

Depending on whether it is a product with raw materials from animal production or vegetable production acts, are all four or. only three dimensions (without animal welfare) to consider and to weight.

As described, the social, animal welfare and health dimensions can clear and concrete labels/standards, indicators and their characteristics and weights covered become.

In the environmental dimension, the two aspects "product" and "company" should company” must be considered separately. The one based on a standardized LCA Eco-Score can be a good starting point for evaluating the "product" aspect (see. Cape. ). However should he around the following points added become:

farming method or. production form (eco/conventional)

Mission from crop protection products and fertilizers

biodiversity (receipt and Protection)

GMO-free

feed origin (at animal products, spec. Origin from Soy)
